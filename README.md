Favorite Top Ten Website
Created a website featuring our favorite top ten marvel superheroes and villains that is responsive on desktop and tablet.
Peer reviewed by: Jared Ly
Peer review comments: The website looks great, I liked the idea of using ratios instead of @media, also I did not know how to make the image for the tab change until now. I would like to see the charaters ranked and the nav bar seems sort of small but the rest of the site was very impressive. Nice job!
